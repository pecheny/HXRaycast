HXRaycast

The library provides ray collision detection with 2d-primitives (Circles and Corridors as for now). 
The corridor (or thick segment) acts like rectangle but differs the way of defining (start point, end point and width).
Most attention had been payed to the math of intersection but there is also an example
 of simple "dungeon" collision detector. However the detector itself is not optimized at all
especially for hi-load. It presented as illustration. Don't be surprised it was enough for my needs of simple games.

See example for more details.
